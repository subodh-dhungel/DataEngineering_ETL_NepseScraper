Its smaller form factor makes it easier to hold in one hand. This i Pad mini comes in a silver finish. The tablet's 7.9"" Retina Display features a native resolution of 2048 x 1536, showing up to 3.1 million pixels at 326 ppi. The Retina Display's capacitive touchscreen lets you utilize all the multi-touch gestures of i OS. The mini 4 features Apple's A8 processor with their 2nd Generation 64-bit architecture, allowing for more robust and powerful apps such as video editing, 3D modeling and CAD, and 3D gaming. Also, the A8 chip supports Metal, a more efficient technology that enables the i Pad mini to render detailed graphics and visual effects. Accompanied by the A8 chip is the M8 motion coprocessor, which measures the motion of the i Pad mini via the accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and barometer, lightening the load of the A8 chip. This frees up the A8 chip to process multiple tasks while enabling it to maintain fast performance. The i Pad mini may have the Retina Display, but it still manages to maintain its 10-hour battery life. That's because the A8 chip isn't just more powerful, it's also more efficient. The i Pad mini comes with i OS and Touch ID. Designed for the i Pad, i OS features News, enhanced multitasking, a shortcut bar, editing tools, updated multi-touch gestures, and more. Touch ID uses your fingerprint to unlock your device as well as make secure purchases in i Tunes, i Books, the App Store, and via Apple Pay. With i Cloud, you can sync your i Pad mini to your other i OS devices and Mac computers. Push photos, download apps, and continue from where you left off in i Books with i Cloud. i Cloud also offers cloud storage so you can back up your contacts, photos, and important documents to Apple's cloud servers. You can also restore your i Pad mini to a previous state using i Cloud.

With a unique traction pattern, it is the ideal choice to perform the perfect Euro Step on the road to glory and success. Look at the notches that split the centre of the outsole - they are the key to your game. These notches give you more flexibility to master lateral movements like the Euro Step with ease, whether during transition or when evading the defence at the basket.

It all began in 1929, when US Army Air Corps Colonel John Macready partnered with New York-based medical equipment manufacturer Bausch & Lomb to create sunglasses for pilots. The goal was to reduce the distraction pilots experienced from the intense light and colors of the sky, and eliminate fogging at high altitudes, which was a problem with traditional aviation goggles. The first version of these glasses, created in 1936, had plastic frames and green Kalichrome lenses that could block glare, and filter out mist or haze without obscuring vision. After being tested by pilots, the plastic frame was switched for a lightweight metal one, and the lenses were switched for much more impact-resistant ones. The following year, the glasses were patented and released publicly as the original Ray-Ban ""Aviator"". Today, the ""Aviator"" model remains Ray-Ban's most popular style, followed closely by the classic ""Wayfarer"", released in 1956, and the ""Olympian"", which gained favor after Peter Fonda wore them in Easy Rider.","{""1_star"":18,""2_stars"":8,""3_stars"":14,""4_stars"":38,""5_stars"":358}",Ray███n,Delivery date & cost shown at checkout,SALE$115.00$230.00Was $230.00,122.71,USD,115.0,230.0

At the same time, Ray-Ban sunglasses are both fashionable and versatile accessories. They offer perfect protection for your eyes thanks to their original design and high-quality materials. Glasses from the Everglasses collection feature photochromic lenses with a blue light filter that provide protection against UV radiation and harmful blue light at the same time. Their photochromic lenses adapt to the surrounding UV radiation conditions. Depending on the UV radiation, the lenses automatically change from a clear to a dark tint within seconds. As soon as the intensity of the UV radiation decreases, the lenses become transparent again, but the UV protection remains. The light-sensitive spectacle lenses thus offer excellent UV protection in different climatic conditions, at any time of the year. This means you can always wear the same pair of glasses without having to sacrifice comfort. Learn more about the photochromic technology in our Complete Guide To Photochromic Lenses. In addition, the blue light filter integrated in the lenses provides excellent protection against harmful blue light emitted by digital devices such as computers, TVs, tablets or mobile phones. The so-called computer glasses help to reduce eye fatigue and burning, they minimise brightness and improve contrast. In this way, they provide eye protection combined with optimal visual comfort. Last but not least, Ray-Ban's high-quality materials guarantee high durability, resilience and maximum functionality. They offer 100% UV protection from sunlight and come with a Ray-Ban case and cleaning cloth.","{""1_star"":176,""2_stars"":79,""3_stars"":177,""4_stars"":654,""5_stars"":6164}",Ray███n,"Free delivery by Mon, Nov 4",$210.00,223.34,USD,210.0,223.34

Justin sunglasses stand out by combining slightly oversized rectangle lenses with sleek, rubberized frames and polarized, gradient lenses. 100% UV Protection - Guaranteed Lots of sunglasses say they protect you from 100% UV, but not all of them actually do. Going with a name you can trust, like Ray-Ban, guarantees that you are really protecting yourself from 100% of UVA and UVB radiation. Why It’s Important to Have 100% Protection Ultraviolet light isn’t something to mess with. Especially when it comes to your eyes. UV can not only damage the skin around your eyes and eyelids, but it can damage the eye itself. The cornea, lens and other parts of the eye can be at risk of developing cataracts, growths and other issues with prolonged exposure. Stick with a leader in eyewear like Ray-Ban, and keep your eyes safe all year long. Gradient Lenses With colored gradient lenses, you get a smooth transition from a solid color to a transparent shade of that same color, top to bottom.

Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee.

Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze.

But in the icy north, Lady Nore of the Court of Teeth has reclaimed the Ice Needle Citadel.

His request felt sinful and devious, and she reveled in it. She answered, ""Yes."" Persephone is the Goddess of Spring in title only. Since she was a little girl, flowers have only shriveled at her touch. After moving to New Athens, she hoped to lead an unassuming life disguised as a mortal journalist. All of that changes when she sits down in a forbidden nightclub to play a hand of cards with a hypnotic and mysterious stranger. Hades, God of the Dead, has built a gambling empire in the mortal world and his favorite bets are rumored to be impossible. But nothing has ever intrigued him as much as the goddess offering him a bargain he can't resist. After her encounter with Hades, Persephone finds herself in a contract with the God of the Dead, and his terms are impossible: Persephone must create life in the Underworld or lose her freedom forever. The bet does more than expose Persephone's failure as a goddess, however. As she struggles to sow the seeds of her freedom, love for the God of the Dead grows--a love that is both captivating and forbidden.","{""1_star"":4,""2_stars"":4,""3_stars"":10,""4_stars"":20,""5_stars"":86}",Ama███.co███,$6.99 delivery,SALE$17.88$25.99Was $25.99,26.92,USD,17.88,25.99

Measuring just 0.5"" (13.1mm) thin and weighing only 2 pounds, the MacBook is compact yet still has a premium feel, thanks to its unibody design. The MacBook features a 12"" Retina display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and 2304 x 1440 native resolution, which results in 226 pixels per inch (ppi). The display also has 178°-wide viewing angles. To deliver the total Retina experience on the MacBook, Apple redesigned the pixels to create a larger aperture, allowing more light to pass through. This enabled Apple to use LED backlighting that's 30 percent more energy efficient than the displays on other Mac notebooks with no loss in brightness. Inside the MacBook you'll find the 6th-Gen (Skylake) Intel Core m3 processor, which is designed with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chip is packed with more transistors than the previous generation, for higher density and more efficient performance. Since the Intel Core m3 only draws 5 watts of power and generates less heat than its predecessors, Apple is able to omit the fan. Instead, the logic board, which is 67% smaller than the one in the 11"" MacBook Air, is seated on top of an anisotropic graphite sheet, which helps disperse any heat that is generated out, to the sides.

For therapist KC Davis, the birth of her second child triggered a stress-mess cycle. The more behind she felt, the less motivated she was to start. She didn’t fold a single piece of laundry for seven months. One life-changing realization restored her sanity—and the functionality of her home: You don’t work for your home; your home works for you. In other words, messiness is not a moral failing. A new sense of calm washed over her as she let go of the shame-based messaging that interpreted a pile of dirty laundry as “I can never keep up” and a chaotic kitchen as “I’m a bad mother.” Instead, she looked at unwashed clothes and thought, “I am alive,” and at stacks of dishes and thought, “I cooked my family dinner three nights in a row.” Building on this foundation of self-compassion, KC devised the powerful practical approach that has exploded in popularity through her TikTok account, @domesticblisters. The secret is to simplify your to-do list and to find creative workarounds that accommodate your limited time and energy. In this book, you’ll learn exactly how to customize your cleaning strategy and rebuild your relationship with your home, including: -How to see chores as kindnesses to your future self, not as a reflection of your worth -How to start by setting priorities -How to stagger tasks so you won’t procrastinate -How to clean in quick bursts within your existing daily routine -How to use creative shortcuts to transform a room from messy to functional With KC’s help, your home will feel like a sanctuary again. It will become a place to rest, even when things aren’t finished. You will move with ease, and peace and calm will edge out guilt, self-criticism, and endless checklists.

Fleas and ticks are killed through contact with the active ingredients — no biting required. *Seresto is water resistant and remains effective following a shampoo treatment, swimming or after exposure to rain or sunlight. Under normal conditions, effectiveness lasts for 8 months. In order to maintain an 8-month duration, dogs must not be bathed more than once per month. For dogs that swim once a month or more, the control duration is reduced to five months for flea control, and reduced to seven months for tick control.","{""1_star"":4285,""2_stars"":991,""3_stars"":1092,""4_stars"":3029,""5_stars"":31159}",Pet███rt,4.8 mi · In stock at Pleasant HillsToday: 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM,SALE$41.99$69.99Was $69.99,41.99,USD,41.99,69.99

Moreover, it's still paired with a Neural Engine chip for advanced machine learning.

The combination of the pro cameras, audio enhancements, and its large display makes the iPad Pro a suitable mobile studio option for creative users.

Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug; more than half take two. In Canada, every fifth person has high blood pressure. In Europe, hypertension is diagnosed in more than 30 percent of the population. And everywhere, adolescent mental illness is on the rise. So what is really “normal” when it comes to health? Over four decades of clinical experience, Maté has come to recognize the prevailing understanding of “normal” as false, neglecting the roles that trauma and stress, and the pressures of modern-day living, exert on our bodies and our minds at the expense of good health. For all our expertise and technological sophistication, Western medicine often fails to treat the whole person, ignoring how today’s culture stresses the body, burdens the immune system, and undermines emotional balance. Now Maté brings his perspective to the great untangling of common myths about what makes us sick, connects the dots between the maladies of individuals and the declining soundness of society—and offers a compassionate guide for health and healing. Cowritten with his son Daniel, The Myth Of Normal is Maté’s most ambitious and urgent book yet.","{""1_star"":2,""2_stars"":3,""3_stars"":3,""4_stars"":3,""5_stars"":85}",Bar███ & ███le,7.0 mi · In stock at PalmdaleToday: 10:00 AM - 8:00 PM,$32.00,32.0,USD,32.0,32.0

Not just from her fiancé and a church full of well-wishers, but from her entire life. Although if you ask her, Naomi's riding to the rescue of her estranged hot mess of a twin, Tina, to Knockemout, a rough-around-the-edges town where disputes are settled the old-fashioned way...with fists and beer. Usually in that order. - Too bad for Naomi, her evil twin hasn't changed at all. After helping herself to Naomi's car and cash, Tina leaves behind something unexpected: the niece Naomi didn't know she had. Now she's a guardian to an eleven-year-old-going-on-thirty with no car, no money, and no plan. - There's a reason this bearded, bad-boy barber doesn't get involved with high-maintenance women, especially not Type-A romantic ones. But since Naomi's life imploded right in front of him, the least Knox can do is help her out of her jam. And just as soon as she stops getting into new trouble, he can leave her alone and get back to his quiet, solitary life. - At least, that's the plan.","{""1_star"":7,""2_stars"":6,""3_stars"":10,""4_stars"":15,""5_stars"":199}",Bar███ & ███le,6.2 mi · In stock at New YorkToday: 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM,$18.99,18.99,USD,18.99,18.99
